## League of Legends
May 2018
* A comprehensive data science project using predictive analytics (scikit-learn in Python) with online game match statistics.
* Presented as HTML markdown documents with code, visualizations, and detailed commentary.
* Also includes Jupyter notebooks (IPYNB), example data (CSV) and a Results Brief memo (PDF).

#### Part I
* This outlines the methods used to access the game's API and build a dataframe from the requested data. It is presented as a tutorial, with the intended audience being League of Legends players who have interest in compiling their own stats, but may have no prior Python or programming experience.

#### Part II
* This section uses the data created in Part I with a focus on analytics and prediction. Segments are devoted to data preprocessing and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling. Models evaluated include decision trees, random forest, logistic regression, ensembles, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.

#### Results
* The final results and recommendations are presented in a brief PDF document. This is based on the format of a memo which a data scientist might send to management when communicating similar findings.


## Predicting Airline Safety
May 2017
This PowerPoint presentation (also available in PDF) demonstrates the use of hierarchical clustering and predictive models to test for a relationship between the past and present safety records of airlines.
